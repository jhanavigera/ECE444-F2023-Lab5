# Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development(TDD):
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code.

Pros of TDD:
- Higher Code Quality: Writing test cases before development encourages the creation of high-quality, maintainable code since developers must write clean code to pass the tests, and it helps prevent unnecessary code.
- Improved Software Design: TDD promotes better software design by prompting developers to think about interfaces and component interactions upfront.
- Faster Debugging: Early bug detection in the development process leads to a more efficient debugging process.
- Higher Productivity: TDD can lead to higher overall productivity due to the benefits of better code quality and fewer debugging efforts.
  
Cons of TDD:
- Time-Consuming: Writing test cases before development can be time-consuming and might slow down the initial coding phase.
- Not Suitable for Highly Dynamic Applications: TDD may not be suitable for applications with rapidly changing functionality, as it can lead to sunk costs in rewriting tests.
- Test Maintenance: Tests need to be maintained alongside project requirements, which can introduce an overhead.
- Test Duplication: TDD can result in test duplication with multiple redundant and repetitive tests to ensure adequate code coverage.
